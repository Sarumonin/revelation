<p>
	Hey you,
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	I know. Dramatic title entry. Caught your eye though, didn&#39;t it?
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	If you know me, if we&#39;ve met, hey it&#39;s me Saru. You know I&#39;m blunt and an open book, so I&#39;ll get straight to it. After 4 wonderful years of constructing this amazing community, growing it from the ashes of a previous community that I belonged to and becoming a world renowned gaming community so quickly, I think it&#39;s time to say goodbye. I remember starting up Eterna when I was just 20 years old, and everything was so new to me. I&#39;ve been in the industry before, and I knew how to manage a community from my past experiences as a GM and, well not proud of it but a community manager to private servers of thousands of players for games that didn&#39;t go well in the West. I remember joining Guardians of the Light, a community that I was a part of at the age of 19, and thinking to myself that I could do it better - and I did. I have never been prouder of anything else in my entire life. I paused my life to be honest, I paused it for a few years to create this community and grow it and flourish it into something different. Immediately from Day 1, people saw how close and tight-knit we were; we were even called a cult at the time. To see us grow from 20 active members, to 300 in one game and completely take over a server for months until we were kicked out - that was amazing. I never thought I&#39;d ever see the day.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Then the community grew more and more, hell I gave it all I could and got into every single MMORPG that was coming out myself and became the guild leader for all of them in order to multi-task and grow the community. I had my experience in my real life from marketing and networking, I knew the ins and outs of how to properly show a product to a multitude of people and be able to say &quot;Why don&#39;t you come and try it out?&quot;. That was 3-4 years ago. Today, we grew so fast and amazingly at record speed. Not trying to prove our worth to a gaming platform or the battlefield of competitions for recruitment, no. We were just having fun and people took notice. We quickly became a target for publishers, developers and indie markets for us to promote their products and hell, even test out the games ourselves with NDAs. We grew so big, so fast.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	So why am I dissolving Eterna Gaming?
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Well, to be honest there&#39;s a lot of good that has been in Eterna Gaming, and has been well received by gaming communities around the globe, however... there&#39;s also the bad. For 3-4 years, we&#39;ve had a lot of challenges overcoming negativity and a dark veil of toxicity from other crowds due to how we set ourselves up. This was my first time truly leading a guild, let alone a huge community such as this one. At first, I handled it badly - I won&#39;t deny that. However, as I grew older, I understood a lot of my mistakes, overlooking failures, and judgement calls were overlapping and creating a chaos that was not meant to be. Eterna Gaming became a hollow shell of itself, and that&#39;s the truth.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&quot;...I think people are attracted to what we convey and represent but don&#39;t really always align with what they want and then the officers and everyone else who were active kept getting caught up in trying to please everyone, that we just kind of pulled the strings too loose&quot;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	A member said that to me, and it&#39;s clear that our structure was wrong from the start. My vision for Eterna Gaming was a great one and one I&#39;ll admit I accomplished. A virtual home away from home for all gamers around the world to enjoy. It happened, it succeeded and there are many members that would attest to it, but at what cost?&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	It&#39;s clear that we messed up a few times around the years and handled situations wrong. Hell, I was a different person 4 years ago and the TERA community know how I was. Now, I&#39;m this professional, networking and marketing fella that streams once in a while and manages to get access to the latest products for his members. Don&#39;t get me wrong, that&#39;s awesome but along with the community sense of home, I changed as well.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	I will cherish you guys and the experiences that you have taught me in the last 3-4 years with this community, truly I will. From my enemies to my closest friends that I&#39;ve met and have left or stayed, thank you. You&#39;ve opened my eyes in the last few months on what I truly want out of a gaming experience, and it&#39;s not this. You guys are amazing and I thank you for coming in to my life and allowing me to experience whether it was joy, pain, regret, or whatever the case - you allowed me to grow as a person, as a gamer and as a community leader.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	So with that, friends after all this time I am disbanding Eterna Gaming.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Well, you didn&#39;t think I would just leave after that, did ya? I am creating an Invite-Only Gaming Community as we speak right now. A 19+ Exclusive, small gaming community. You may have noticed a few bumps on our social media management course when our Facebook Name changed and Twitter Handle changed before we deleted all our Tweets, Posts and Likes. We&#39;re starting 100% from fresh, with a new perspective on virtual life.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Ascendum Gaming</strong>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Ah yes, you may have seen this name around slowly here and there in the last few days - and I apologized. If you noticed our Facebook Page, which was the Eterna Gaming one, it is not entirely empty of posts, likes and history. The same goes for our Twitter, though we can&#39;t kick our followers. Anyways! Yes, Ascendum Gaming will be the brand new, fresh gaming experience that I will be starting in the next few days and if you&#39;re a fan of the work we&#39;ve done or the potential we have in Eterna Gaming, keep an eye out for us. We might surprise you in the next game with a brand new attitude and a fresh perspective.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<strong>What does this mean for the rest of Eterna Gaming?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Well, old friends. This is the last email you will receive from us. This is the last time you&#39;ll probably see the Eterna Gaming website and forums, and the last time you&#39;ll see our Teamspeak. As for your membership, everyone will be deleted entirely. This is not a move from one community to another or a transfer of sorts - I am completely dismantling Eterna Gaming and starting from fresh with a brand new community.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	I however, personally and most gratiously, thank you for all your support towards us. Whether you were an active member, an active leader, an inactive member, a donator, a fan, someone who just wanted more info on a game, or whatever the case - thank you for choose Eterna Gaming as your gaming experience, we really hope that you enjoyed your time with us.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Ascendum will rise from the fall of Eterna, and in the future we will be accepting registrations with a brand new set of guidelines never before seen in Eterna Gaming. If you were invited to the Community, welcome to Ascendum. If you were not, please do not take it harshly as it was a limited amount of invites as the main core of the new community.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<strong>Thank you guys and in the next week you will see the brand new website for the new community:</strong>
